# Readme for dotfiles  

### Purpose  
   *  make my life easy  
   *  ride with the flow  
   *  learn to use github  

### Point  
   *  executing `apply_dots.sh` makes dotfiles apply  

### Issue  
   *  only for zsh and nvim  
   *  i would be happy if i succeed in including this file into my dockerfile  
      but it is hassle
